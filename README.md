# Copy-file-to-folder-Python


In this example, I have imported two modules called shutil, and os this module helps in automating the process of copying and removing files and directories.

We have to write a path for both source and destination. We have to use shutil.copyfile(src, dst) to copy the file from source to destination. Along with the path, the name of the file with its extension should be written.

source= r'D:\Newfolder\filename.txt' is the source path. name.txt is the filename that I have created with the .txt extension.
destination = r'E:\filename.txt' is the destination path. Here, I have created a folder called Newfolder to copy the file name.txt in the Newfolder.
